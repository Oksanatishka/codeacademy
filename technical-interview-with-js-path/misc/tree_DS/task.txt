1. In this exercise, weâ€™ve constructed a sample menu tree, however some of the meal items are in the wrong category. Can you spot which ones and place them in the correct locations?
Open script.js and run it. You will see a pretty printout of the menu tree.

    Menu
    -- Breakfast
    -- -- Cereal
    -- -- BBQ Chicken
    -- -- Oatmeal
    -- Lunch
    -- -- Soup
    -- -- Sandwich
    -- -- Lasagna
    -- Dinner
    -- -- Yogurt
    -- -- Filet Mignon
    -- -- Fish Florentine

2. Two entries in the menu tree are dislocated. Write code to move each one to the correct location. Print the tree under the title Corrected Menu.

3. Choose a tree traversal method whose output resembles the ordering of .print() and call it.
