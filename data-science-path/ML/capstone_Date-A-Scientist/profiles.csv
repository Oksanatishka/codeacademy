<br />
i would love to think that i was some some kind of intellectual:
either the dumbest smart guy, or the smartest dumb guy. can't say i
can tell the difference. i love to talk about ideas and concepts. i
forge odd metaphors instead of reciting cliches. like the
simularities between a friend of mine's house and an underwater
salt mine. my favorite word is salt by the way (weird choice i
know). to me most things in life are better as metaphors. i seek to
make myself a little better everyday, in some productively lazy
way. got tired of tying my shoes. considered hiring a five year
old, but would probably have to tie both of our shoes... decided to
only wear leather shoes dress shoes.<br />

about you:<br />
<br />
you love to have really serious, really deep conversations about
really silly stuff. you have to be willing to snap me out of a
light hearted rant with a kiss. you don't have to be funny, but you
have to be able to make me laugh. you should be able to bend spoons
with your mind, and telepathically make me smile while i am still
at work. you should love life, and be cool with just letting the
wind blow. extra points for reading all this and guessing my
favorite video game (no hints given yet). and lastly you have a
good attention span.","currently working as an international agent for a freight
forwarding company. import, export, domestic you know the
